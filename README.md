# meFood App

A simple food menu prototype built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** for Android. Recipe descriptions were generated with ChatGPT following a defined theme.

## Features
- Bottom navigation bar for easy switching between screens
- UI built using Jetpack Compose
- Animatable list items

## Tech Stack
- Kotlin
- Android Studio
- Jetpack Compose

## Learning Context
This project was inspired by **Unit 4 of the Android Basics in Compose course**.
During development, I focused on implementing:  
- **Drawable resources for multiple density buckets**, primarily targeting **xxhdpi** for simplicity and testing.  
- **Adaptive app icons** using Inkscape to format images to XML for flexibility. Adobe Express was used as a helper to quickly generate simple source images.  
- **Animatable list content** in Jetpack Compose to enhance UI responsiveness and user experience.  

These exercises helped me understand Android resource management, vector graphics integration, and Compose animation APIs.
