    <string name="gaeng_som_meal_name">Spicy Salmon Gaeng Som</string>
    <string name="gaeng_som_meal_desc">This is a dish I’ve made since I was young. It’s simple but strong. The broth is thin, no coconut milk—just water, tamarind, and chili paste we pound by hand with garlic, shallot, and dried shrimp. Sour comes first, then the heat. That’s how it should be.
        \n\nI usually use fish—something firm, like snakehead or sea bass. Prawns are good too. For vegetables, whatever’s fresh: green papaya, long beans, or cabbage. You cook it just until tender, not too soft. It’s not sweet, not rich. It’s sharp, hot, and clean. We eat it with rice, maybe a fried egg on the side. To me, this curry wakes up the mouth. It’s everyday food—but it speaks loudly.</string>
    <string name="vege_fiesta_meal_name">Vege Fiesta Bowl</string>
    <string name="vege_fiesta_meal_desc">This one is not Thai—but I like it. My daughter studied abroad in Mexico and came home talking about the colors, the spices, the way people eat together. She showed me how to roast corn, cook black beans with cumin, and make lime dressing with just the right kick.
        \n\nWe played around in the kitchen—some days with avocado, some with pickled onions, some with crispy tofu. Now it’s a bowl full of bright things: roasted sweet potato, black beans, corn, rice, fresh herbs, a little chili, a squeeze of lime. It’s not how I grew up eating—but it feels familiar. Fresh, spicy, and made with care.</string>
